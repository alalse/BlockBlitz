# BlockBlitz
> A never-ending game about placing blocks on a board.

Description
-----------
The game BlockBlitz is about endlessly placing blocks of different dimensions and shapes on a board of 10x10 tiles. If the segments
of a placed block together with the segments of some previously placed blocks form a continuous line from one end of the board to
another, vetically or horizontally, the line of segments gets removed from the board while the player gets a point. Care needs to
be taken by the player when placing blocks because a block can not be placed in a position where any of its segments overlap with any
of the segments of a previously placed block. If the board fills up and there is no more space for new blocks the game is over.
